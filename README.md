## Overview
Introduction:
Bike sharing systems have emerged as a modern solution to urban transportation challenges, offering convenient and eco-friendly alternatives to traditional modes of travel. This data analysis project aims to explore and understand the dynamics of bike sharing usage using a dataset from the Capital Bikeshare system in Washington D.C., USA.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the factors influencing bike rental counts and to gain insights into user behavior and system performance. By leveraging data on environmental conditions, seasonal variations, and other relevant parameters, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the dataset.

## Project Structure
- `dashboard/`: This directory contains dashboard.py which is used to create dashboards of data analysis results.
- `data/`: Directory containing the raw CSV data files.
- `notebook.ipynb`: This file is used to perform data analysis.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine: https://github.com/AriyovaBanua/data-analyst-dicoding.git
```
git clone 
```
2. Go to the project directory
```
cd data-analyst-dicoding
```
3. Install the required Python packages by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Data Wrangling**: Data wrangling scripts are available in the `notebook.ipynb` file to prepare and clean the data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore and analyze the data using the provided Python scripts. EDA insights can guide your understanding of e-commerce public data patterns.

3. **Visualization**: Run the Streamlit dashboard for interactive data exploration:

```
cd data-analyst-dicoding/dashboard
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
Access the dashboard in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Data Sources
